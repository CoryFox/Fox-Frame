You should also keep whoever your insurer is up to date with any changes in your circumstances or you may end up invalidating your cover.  In fact, we recommend that you regularly review your policy to make any changes you may need, such as marriage, a new home or a new addition to your family.","ACCORDION_6_TITLE":"How Do I Cut The Cost Of Life Insurance?","ACCORDION_6_COPY":"There is no time like the present to buy life insurance if you take out a policy as young as possible this will mean you will pay less for any premiums.  Improving your health like losing weight and stopping smoking will also significantly reduce your premiums.  Premiums can vary from insurer to insurer so you can often save money if you compare prices. The QuoteHound can help you get a great deal on your life insurance policy in a matter of minutes.","ACCORDION_5_TITLE":"Are Life Insurance Premiums Fixed?","ACCORDION_5_COPY":"Level and decreasing-term insurance, and family income benefit policies, usually have guaranteed fixed premiums throughout the policy term.  But make sure to check the small print as some firms offer premiums that can be reviewed every five to ten years and they normally go up in price.  Whole-of-life assurance is different because it is typically linked to a specific investment. So if the investment does not perform well, then the premium is likely to increase so the insurer doesn\u2019t lose money.","ACCORDION_4_TITLE":"Does Your Life Insurance Pay Out Stay The Same No Matter When You Die?","ACCORDION_4_COPY":"This will depend on what kind of life insurance policy you take out.","ACCORDION_3_TITLE":"Can I Get Life Insurance Through My Employer?","ACCORDION_3_COPY":"While your employer may offer life insurance in the form of a \u2018death-in-service benefit\u2019. This, like regular life insurance, pays out a lump sum if you die while in employment, at a rate that\u2019s usually four times your annual salary.  While this can be a valuable benefit, you may need to take out additional life insurance cover depending on certain factors, such as how much you owe on your mortgage or any other financial obligations.","ACCORDION_2_TITLE":"Should I Bother With Life Insurance?","ACCORDION_2_COPY":"If you are a single person with no one depending on you or your income, then you probably have no need for life insurance.
