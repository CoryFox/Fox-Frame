If you want more enquiries, you do not need a complicated funnel. You need clarity, trust, and a friction-free next step.

## 1. Start with high-intent search
Google's local search research shows strong intent: 76% of people who search for something nearby visit a business within a day, and 28% make a purchase. That is the moment your site needs to show up, load fast, and make contact easy.

## 2. Make your offer obvious in seconds
Visitors decide quickly. Your first screen should answer three questions: Who is this for? What do I get? What do I do next? If those are clear, more people keep reading and take action.

## 3. Use proof that reduces doubt
BrightLocal's 2024 survey shows that review responses affect trust, with 88% of people more likely to use a business that responds to all reviews. Add reviews, show real work, and make it easy to leave feedback.

## 4. Keep the path simple
One primary action per page beats ten. If your goal is a booked call, make that the easiest action everywhere.

## 5. Track one or two real outcomes
Do not track everything. Track the actions that matter: calls, forms, and booking clicks. When you can see what works, you can improve it.
