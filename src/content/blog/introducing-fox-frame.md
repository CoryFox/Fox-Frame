If you run a trade, a local service, or a small brand, your website is not a hobby. It is a tool that should bring enquiries, explain what you do clearly, and make it easy to take the next step.

That is why we started Fox & Frame Studio. We build modern, premium-feel sites for small businesses without agency pricing or jargon. We keep it simple, we explain it clearly, and we stay close enough to help long after launch.

## What we believe works

### 1. Credibility beats cleverness
People judge a website quickly. The Stanford Web Credibility Guidelines highlight practical signals like professional design, clear contact options, and easy-to-use layouts. We build those fundamentals first, so visitors trust you before they even read the detail.

### 2. Local intent is high intent
Google's "near me" research shows that local searchers are ready to act. In one widely cited study, 76% of people who searched for something nearby visited a business within a day, and 28% made a purchase. That is why we focus on location clarity, fast contact routes, and a direct booking path.

### 3. Trust is built in public
BrightLocal's 2024 survey found that 88% of consumers would use a business that responds to all reviews, compared with 47% that would use a business that does not respond. We design space for proof and make it easy to collect and show it, without making the page feel salesy.

## Who we are for
We work with sole traders, trades, local services, start-ups, side hustles, and small e-commerce brands. We also support agencies and growth-focused teams on landing pages and conversion work.

If you want a site that looks premium, speaks clearly, and helps customers take action, we should talk.
